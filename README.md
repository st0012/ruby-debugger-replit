# Ruby debugger on Replit

This is a demo for trying out Ruby's official debugger [ruby/debug](https://github.com/ruby/debug). 

Once you run the program, it should stop at a breakpoint in the `Foo#forth_call` method.

## Gain Context

You can then use these commands to gain contextual information before you start moving around:

- `bt` to see all the backtraces with rich information like call arguments
- `ls` to see what's available to the current `Foo` instance
- `info` to see variables that are accessible to the current scope
